# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript/Node.js project that automatically translates English terminology lists from ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765 (Systems and software engineering vocabulary) to Japanese using AI agents. The project analyzes input English glossaries and generates appropriate Japanese translations with quality validation.

## Development Commands

### Build and Run

- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm start` - Run the main application (scripts/main.ts)

### Code Quality

- `npm run fmt` - Format code with Prettier (printWidth: 150)

### TypeScript Execution

- This project uses `"type": "module"` so TypeScript files can be executed directly with Node.js
- Use `node src/filename.ts` to run TypeScript files directly (no tsx required)

### TypeScript Configuration

- Uses strict TypeScript configuration with ES2023 target
- NodeNext module resolution
- No emit mode (noEmit: true)
- Extensive strict type checking enabled
- Source files expected in `src/` directory

## Architecture

### Project Structure

- `src/main.ts` - Main entry point (currently minimal)
- TypeScript configuration optimized for Node.js with ES modules
- Prettier formatting with 150 character line width

### Technical Stack

- Node.js >= 24.0.0 required
- TypeScript 5.7+ with strict configuration
- ES modules (`"type": "module"`)
- Prettier for code formatting

## Development Notes

The project is currently in early development phase with minimal implementation. The main application logic is expected to be built out in the scripts directory or migrated to a proper src structure as indicated by the TypeScript configuration.

## Translation System Design

Refer to `docs/design.md` for detailed architecture and implementation plan for the ISO 24765 terminology translation system. The system processes 4,634 English terms by converting JSON to JSONL format for efficient streaming processing.
